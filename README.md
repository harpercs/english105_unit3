# Uninsured Children in North Carolina 

This is a repository containing information from a [County Health dataset for 2014 and 2015](https://github.com/harpercs/english105_unit3/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) that has been subseted to specifically look at data contained in the "Uninsured children" in North Carolina by county in 2014.

It contains 5 files:
1. The original dataset
2. The instructions to subset the data
3. The end result after subsetting the data
4. A visualization of the subsetted data 
5. This README file

This dataset is to provide information on the amount of uninsured children in North Carolina by county in 2014.

This dataset can be used to analyze the amount of uninsured children in the North Carolina by county and can be used to produce visuals of the data to help North Carolinians to understand this issue. I think that it can be used as a wake up call to the amount of children that are uninsured. This could mean the difference between a child going to the doctor or remaining sick or injured which could result in them having long term problems. It provides that data to show people which counties need extra help to provide for the future of our state. It could help for people to see which counties need help and to promote the issue to the government.

I chose this dataset because I think that children should be able to have access to health care and that insurance is a way that allows people to be able to access healthcare at a price they can afford. I wanted to know which counties across the state had higher percentages of children that are uninsured.
